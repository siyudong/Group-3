We each have uploaded how we think the group could go about completing each of our proposals in order to get a better sense about which one is the most realistic.  
For my proposal we would use data from the Academy of Motion Picture's database on acceptance speeches.  Earlier in the year we were able to determine the most used words in MLK's I Have a Dream speech, and we would use a similar method to determine the most used words or phrases in Oscar acceptance speeches.  This could provide us with an interesting look at the similarities and differences in speeches.  For example it would allow us to determine which people have been thanked in the most speeches (producers, directors), how many people thanked their parents, and where God ranks amongst the people who have been thanked the most.
